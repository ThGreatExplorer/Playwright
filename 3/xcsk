# /** Challenge Assignment *********************************************************************
#  * Q: How would the problem that is mentioned in the dialog between Eli Barzilay and the AI 
#  * affect the students in this course? 
#  * A: We will inevitably have to deal with floating point numbers in our software development
#  * careers, but few people actually know how inexact numbers are handled by our machines.
#  * The problem highlighted by Eli Barzilay is insidious because the surface syntax by itself 
#  * does not indicate that either expression is better than other, but there is a tangible
#  * difference.
#  *
#  * Q: How does the design of Bare Bones avoid the problem?
#  * A: BareBones does not define a multiplication expression, so floating point rounding errors 
#  * introduced by division cannot be amplified.
